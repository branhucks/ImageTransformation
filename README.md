# Image Transformation
### Program Description: 

This program will read in a .ppm file specified by the
command-line argument following the name of the executable/binary file.
The program will then perform one of four image transformations: grayscale,
invert, rotate, or shrink. The program will then save the new transformed
image to a new .ppm file adding "_theexecutedtransformation" to the end of the
original filename.
